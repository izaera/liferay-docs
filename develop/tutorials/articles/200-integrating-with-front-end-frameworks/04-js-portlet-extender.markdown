# Creating JavaScript Portlets with 100% JavaScript Tools

Portlets are built on Java, and therefore to write one, you must have a 
knowledge and understanding of how Java works. This can be quite the hurdle for 
front-end developers who want to create JavaScript portlets. Not to worry 
though. A knowledge of Java is no longer needed. Thanks to the 
[JS Portlet Extender](), 
[Liferay bundle generator](), 
and 
[liferay-npm-bundler](), 
developers can create and develop JavaScript portlets in @product@ using 100% 
JavaScript tools. This requires no XML or Java to work. The only requirement is 
the JavaScript entry point for the portlet.

This tutorial shows how to use the JS Portlet Extender app, Liferay Bundle 
Generator, and liferay-npm-bundler to create JavaScript Portlets for @product@.

**Important:** The JS Portlet Extender is a Labs application available for 
Liferay DXP and Liferay Portal CE 7.1 GA6+. Apps designated as Labs are 
experimental and not supported by Liferay. They're released to accelerate the 
availability of useful and cutting-edge features. This status may change without 
notice. Please download and use Labs apps at your own discretion.

Follow these steps to create your JavaScript portlet with 100% JavaScript tools:

1.  Install Node.js and npm if you don't already have them installed.

2.  Install Yeoman for the generator:

        npm install -g yeoman
        
3.  Install the liferay-bundle generator:

        npm install -g generator-liferay-bundle
        
4.  Run the generator, selecting the JavaScript portlet you want to create, and 
    answer the prompts that follow:

        yo liferay-bundle

    ![Figure 2: The liferay-bundle generator prompts you for portlet options.](../../images/liferay-bundle-generator-prompts.png)

5.  Configure the main module of your JavaScript portlet. Note that it must 
    export a JavaScript function with the following signature:

        function({portletNamespace, contextPath, portletElementId}) {
          ...
        }

    The entry point function receives one object parameter with three fields:

    - **portletNamespace**: the unique namespace of the portlet as defined in 
    the Portlet specification.
    - **contextPath**: the URL path that can be used to retrieve bundle 
    resources from the browser (it doesn't contain the protocol, host, or port, 
    just the absolute path).
    - **portletElementId**: the DOM identifier of the portlet's `<div>` node 
    that can be used to render HTML.

    The *JavaScript based portlet*'s main `index.js` file configuration is shown 
    below:
    
        export default function main({portletNamespace, contextPath, 
        portletElementId}) {
            
            const node = document.getElementById(portletElementId);
            
            node.innerHTML =`
            <div>
            <span class="tag">Porlet Namespace:</span>
            <span class="value">${portletNamespace}</span>
            </div>
            <div>
            <span class="tag">Context Path:</span>
            <span class="value">${contextPath}</span>
            </div>
            <div>
            <span class="tag">Portlet Element Id:</span>
            <span class="value">${portletElementId}</span>
            </div>`
            
        }

6.  Specify the portlet's initial JS module in the `main` entry of the 
    `package.json`. Below is the `main` entry for the 
    *JavaScript based portlet*:
    
        "main": "index.js"
        
7.  Specify any portlet properties you want to configure, under the `portlet` 
    section of your portlet's `package.json` file. Note that these are the same 
    properties you would define in the Java `@Component` annotation of a 
    portlet, as defined in the 
    [liferay-portlet-app_7_1_0.dtd](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/definitions/liferay-portlet-app_7_1_0.dtd.html). 
    The configuration for the *JavaScript based portlet* liferay-bundle 
    generator option is shown below:

        "portlet": {
          "javax.portlet.display-name": "my-js-portlet-project",
          "javax.portlet.security-role-ref": "power-user,user",
          "com.liferay.portlet.instanceable": true,
          "com.liferay.portlet.display-category": "category.sample",
          "com.liferay.portlet.header-portlet-css": "/css/styles.css"
          },

8.  To create an extender bundle with `liferay-npm-bundler`, follow the standard 
    process, but provide the extra `create-jar` option to the bundler's 
    `.npmbundlerrc` file to make it output the final JAR. The 
    *JavaScript based portlet*'s configuration is shown below:

        {
            "create-jar": {
                "auto-deploy-portlet": "true",
                "output-dir": "dist",
                "web-context-path": "/my-portlet"
            }
        }

    Valid options are:

    - **auto-deploy-portlet**: specifies that the bundler should create a JAR 
    file to be processed by the extender. Defaults to `true` and only needs to 
    be set to `false` when you want to create a bundle without a portlet 
    (for instance, if you want to provide shared npm packages to be used with 
    [imports](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/changes-between-liferay-npm-bundler-1x-and-2x#manually-deduplicating-through-importing).
    - **output-dir**: specifies where to put the generated JAR file. Defaults to 
    the standard output folder. You may want to specify a different location so 
    that the JAR and intermediate files are not mixed.
    - **web-context-path**: specifies the URL path where static resources are 
    located in the bundle. Defaults to `<project name>-<project version>`. 

9.  Finally, if you specified your app server information when your portlet was 
    created with the liferay-bundle generator, you can deploy your portlet by 
    running the command below:

        npm run deploy

    The app server information is defined in the `liferayDir` entry of the 
    portlet's `.npmbuildrc`:
    
        {
        	"liferayDir": "C:\\Users\\liferay\\opt\\Liferay\\bundles\\7.1.0-ga1\\liferay-ce-portal-7.1.0-ga1",
        	"webpack": {
        		"rules": [
        			{
        				"test": "src\\/.*\\.js$",
        				"use": "babel-loader"
        			}
        		]
        	}
        }

    Alternatively, you can run the commands below:
    
    - `npm run build`: Places the output of liferay-npm-bundler in your 
    project's build subfolder. The standard output contains the processed files 
    and a JAR file, named upon the name and version of the project, that can be 
    manually deployed to your @product@ instance.
    
    - `npm run start`: lets you test the application in a local webpack 
    installation instead of a @product@ server. This speeds up development 
    because you can see live changes without any need to deploy. Note, however, 
    that because this is separate from a Liferay instance, you don't have access 
    to Liferay's APIs.
